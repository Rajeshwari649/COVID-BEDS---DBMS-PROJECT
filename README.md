ABSTRACT:


In this pandemic situation , it is suggested to have social distancing and avoid people gathering in all places especially in hospitals. After the second phase of covid-19 the common scenario people are experiencing is the unavailability of beds in hospitals . Even so many people have lost their lives while waiting in hospitals in search of beds . In order to avoid patients waiting in hospitals for hours and hours in search of beds ,they can use our website. Here we have designed a website(COVID-BEDS) where people can check the availability of beds . Also, If the bed with the patient’s required facilities in that particular hospital is vacant or available then the person can book the bed. In this system we have used html , css for front-end and php , mysql for the backend. Here we will updating the database manually from time to time .People who are
affected with covid and in search of beds will be benefited through this system.


IMPLEMENTATION:


If a person already has an account in our website, then he/she can use the login page to login into our website by entering the username and password. On the other hand if the person is new to our website then he/she can use the signup page in our website to create an account by entering his/her username and password . After entering the above credentials, a page with the list of hospitals in Chennai will be displayed. People can select the hospital from the list which is nearer to their location. It also show the location and contact details of the hospital. After selection, a page with beds available in that hospital will be displayed. This page also shows the number of beds available with additional features like covid bed, bed with ventilator and ICU , bed with or without oxygen. If the patient’s preferred bed is available in that particular hospital the person can book the bed by entering the details in the form by clicking the book my bed button available along with the list of hospitals in the main
page.

While entering the patient’s details , the person have to include the patient’s name , age , gender ,blood group, hospital name, type of bed and phone number. Suppose if selected bed is not available, then a page with the message “beds are unavailable” will be displayed. On the other hand if the selected bed is available then the patient’s details will be recorded into the database and the bed will be booked. After clicking the book button, if the preferred bed in the hospital is available, a page with “Your bed has been booked
successfully!” and patient id will be displayed. This patient id can be used for further references in the hospital. The database gets modified automatically
